    <section class='bio'>Bio: I am a web developer and soon-to-be graduate of the Web Development Career Path bootcamp at Bloc. I love coding because of the problem solving opportunities it provides and I love seeing my projects and ideas come to life. I enjoy learning new skills and picking up new hobbies. Other than coding, I have recently learned to play the drums!</section>

    Project title: Quiz App
    Project description: this is a project I completed while working towards my fullstack developer certificate with Thinkful. It is a simple quiz showcasing all that I had learned in the first section of the course. I am a huge San Antonio Spurs fan so I decided to make my quiz all about the Spurs NBA team. 
    List of technologies used: For this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
